    <h2 id="about-me">About Me!</h2>
    <p id="aboutText">Welcome to my Professional Portfolio! My Name is Arjun! I am a programming bootcamper at the University of Birmingham! Located in the West 
        Midlands, I find the university such a promising place for coders and learners like myself to advance into our career and be able to 
        grasp the knowledge on being a full-stack developer within the web or software industries.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had chosen to be on this course because I have a passion for technology and wanting to build and create with coding. 
        Some of the things I want to build are software programming, creating games using C++/JavaScript or websites that involve a full-stack level of programming.

            <a href="https://github.com/arjunkhakh/Creating-A-README-File-By-Arjun"><section id="image3"></section></a>
            This Application is a ReadMe Generator. It creates a README File when the user prompts information into the command line. Each piece of information is put onto the right section of what they answered into the README file. 
            This is achieved by putting all the questions into the terminal and for the user to answer them which gets filled into the ReadMe.

        <a href="https://github.com/arjunkhakh/Online-E-Commerce-For-The-Latest-TechnoLovers"><section id="image4"></section></a>
        On This Application, I had created a Back-End E-Commerce API Application. For this application, The user can create,update,view or delete Categories, Products and Tags. 
        I had achieved this by using Insomnia and creating the routes. I put the routes into Insomnia which then I had made all requests to test and see if the API will respond to my input.

        On This Application, I had built this with another team member (Contacts Are In the ReadMe for Details) and have built an application which the user can view Renewable Energy Products.
        Users can sign in and view the products and also Create and Delete Products for other users to view and use. 
        Users can use this application to view different kinds of products from many categories.
